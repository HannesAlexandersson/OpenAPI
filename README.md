# OpenAPI
project about using open apis during Yrgo educational plan for webdev.
Building a free to play, html based trivia game that fetches trivia questions from the opentdb.com DB.
This is for educational purposes and NOT for commercial endevours. 

I also took the liberty and made another project. I made an recipe finder using the ninjaAPI recipie API. At first I wanted to bring 2 api's together and fetch recipies from one and images of the food from another. But comin across an good working and maintained free open api for food pics turned out to be much harder then I initially thought. So alas, there is (ATM) no pics to the recipies. But in a way it should imo count as towards the req for working with 2 api's.
