# OpenAPI
project about using open apis during Yrgo educational plan for web-developers. DEPLOYED SITE AT: https://alexanderochson.se/OpenAPI/

## Explanation
I used 3 different api's to complete this project. 
1. Trivia questions from the opendb.com api. 
2. Recipefinder from APIninjas api. 
3. random picture generator from APIninjas api. 

## Navigation HUB
The start page, wich consists of the index, head, footer and navbar .php files are a sort of gathering place
for the different api's I have worked with for this project. From there the user can easily navigate to and from the different applications. 

I tried to seperate the files and structure it as we have been taught. But, since I started that process AFTER we had our last lesson the project files where already a big mess. So I tried to clean up what I could, seperate as much as I dared. Now each application is stored under the view folder. It has its own css and script files. 

The starting page (the last one to be built) is more structured since I could do it from the start. So there I have seperated each section of the page and give each section its own css and js. For example the navbar has its own css file and its own JS file aswell as the footer and main etc etc.
