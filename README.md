# OpenAPI
project about using open apis during Yrgo educational plan for webdevelopers.

## Navigation HUB
I started off making an simple trivia game for the assignment. Since it was rather simple I decided to make another application after I was done with the trivia game. So i search the open API github repo to find any interesting api's I could use. 

I tried a couple of them out, but didnt really find any that I felt stronlgy about. So I started to google for open api's. After a while I came across APIninjas homepage. A place where they gathered all their API's. Thats where I found an recipe API. So I started building a recipe finder app. When I was done with that I felt something was lacking to the app. The api didnt send any pictures of the recipes with the response data. So I started looking for an api that could generate food pictures. Well to make a long story short, I wanst able to make the api match the recipes to any pictures of that course. Since the timebudget for this assignment doesnt really allow for anymore work I had to settle for random placeholder pictures for my recipes (for now). 

So now I was in a situation where I had techniclly 3 different API's. So I build a simple navigationhub to gather them in and offer a user interface to navigate between the api's. Perhaps I'll revisit this project in the future and add more api's to the network.
